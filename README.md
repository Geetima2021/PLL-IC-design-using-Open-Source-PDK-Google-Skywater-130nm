## Overview

This repository deals with the workshop which signinfies the beginning of a new era of “Design at $0” as visualize and materialize by the continuous effort of the entire VSD team and [Lakshmi Sathi](https://github.com/lakshmi-sathi/avsdpll_1v8). The workshop is also another standard VSD IAT cloud based 2 days workshop with 24 hrs accessibility of the platform to each participants. The VSD IAT platform provides all the necessary material including remote access of their ubuntu server for carrying on the labs with the pre-loaded tools required for the particular workshop. Assessment is also done through the multiple choice questions, including both the theoritical understanding and lab exercise. However, the installation procedure of the required tools viz ngspice and magic for use in our local system is covered. The snippet of the platform and lab instance is as shown  below.
